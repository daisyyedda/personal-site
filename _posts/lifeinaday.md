I was feeling fatigued for the entire day.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

During the morning meeting, my camera was accidentally on, thus me with the posture of lying in couch and listening got captured and presented in front of my colleagues (including my supervisor probably). I thought about apologizing, but then I hesitated and ended up not doing that cuz it might make people think about that awkward scene again.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

I emailed my completed academic waste aka work report to my supervisor at 9:13am, and received no response as of now. Hopefully he can get back to me before the long weekend.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

Went to bed at around 9pm, and was waken up by a scam call from China at 5:46am. I thus slept for 9 hours-ish, and dreamt a lot.

&nbsp;

2022.04.12

============================================

Veronica and I went to Maryann's place again. Her boyfriend aka Jiarong was there too.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

When we got in, Jiarong poured Veronica a bottle of something, to Veronica but not to me.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

Veronica greeted Jiarong gently and thanked him. I was awkwardly standing beside, pretending to be blind as if this would make the mini drama not including me as the main character.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

Maryann and her roommate went out to get food for dinner. They are craving seafood yet they are allergic to it.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

I was sitting on their couch, watching those down-to-earth actors in the TV shows. Light beams from LEDs are illuminating the entire chambre, making me want to sleep.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

They came back and went to the kitchen to cook. Jiarong, Veronica and I then went out to get food as well.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

We got a pineapple ice cream (the one with ice cream inside of a real pineapple, was popular on social media once a while ago).

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

Jiarong drove us back. The ice cream was cold so I suggested to heat it up using the microwave.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

Veronica agreed and she put the pineapple into the microwave, closed the door, and set the timer to I-don’t-remember-how-many minutes.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

She then left and went to somewhere (not sure where but she's out of my sight).

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

I was standing there feeling infuriated for no reason until I realized that the heating is still on and the juice and pulps of the pineapple are splashing out of the microwave.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

I was terrified.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

No one was there.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

After a moment of contemplation, I decided to be the heroic character who saves the scene so I pulled the plug out of the power extension cord and carried the microwave with me and started running.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

BOOMMM

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

The glass-made portion of the microwave door, all of a sudden, crashed into splinters.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

I was bleeding.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

The chambre is in hollow quietude.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

Where is Veronica? Where is Jiarong?

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

She isn't there.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

He isn't there.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


============================================

I woke up.
