Summer seemed never to begin, yet the days stretched endlessly long, far too long.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

Sipping ice americano during a break from work, grabbing snacks as I wandered through the park, visiting the bridge for the thousandth time... These moments would eventually manifest themselves as memory fragments, nestled deep within my mind.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

The neighbourhood I live in is way too chaotic. It was hard for me to fall asleep at night, especially when the ambulances kept scouring.

========================================

Summer had passed, yet the river still sparkled excessively when the sun glanced at it.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

On my flight home, I was drafting a letter to a profoundly special person in my life. He was an arts-sci hybrid, new-wave yet old school, his inner child was outward bound. He mattered lots to me once a while. During those nights, we would delve into Karl Marx's The Process of Production of Capital. He read at double my pace, but always paused, waiting for me to catch up.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

Lost in thoughts of how to begin the letter, the plane landed unexpectedly, and I got kicked out from the airport. And by saying kick out, I mean physically—EJECTED by an obese, bearded man, around 300 pounds, who kicked me out with his left leg.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

The next second, I closed my eyes, and got teleported.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

When I reopened my eyes, I was back in Waterloo. 

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

Everything got revamped. The building where I once lived now stood in a quaint village. Thankfully, a shuttle bus was provided for commuting. As I got onto the bus, I encountered an old friend; our greetings were awkward. Fortunately, he got off the next minute. 

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

As soon as I got off, my legs began to melt and I couldn't walk anymore. Yet the tiny neighborhood had a strict rule: I had to get back before sunset, otherwise the whole city would turn into a post-apocalyptic wasteland.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

What could I do? I checked my phone; it was 7:48 PM, the sun was about to go down, yet my legs kept melting and I couldn’t move at all.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

All of a sudden, a guy who was playing basketball nearby ran into me and said he could save my legs by making me consume tons of ice cream bars.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

He told me to wait there and he would run to a nearby convenience store to get those and save my life.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

I didn't want to count on this, but I had no other options.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

So I kept waiting.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

My legs melted up to my knees.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

My shoulders started melting too.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

He still didn't come back.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

Maybe he forgot to come back.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

Maybe he was just slow.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

Maybe he had more urgent stuff to do.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

Maybe.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


========================================

I woke up.
